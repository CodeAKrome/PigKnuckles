# FACTRY mode

## Somehow I managed to put the radio into what I'm calling Factory mode while turning the FT-500 on holding buttons to put it into Wires-X mode (GM + X + Pwr).
### There is a gray bar across the top of the display which says FACTRY, right justified.

## In FACTRY mode:
- Menus have Japanese writing.
- Holding the Main button to bring up the menu to do a factory reset opens the AES adjustment menu and Back returns to main screen.
- There is no way to reach the factory reset menu.
- Attempting to access the factory reset menu opens the AES adjustment menu instead, and pressing Back returns to the main screen.
- Pressing Func brings up the quick menu, but you cannot select anything and this sometimes causes the interface to freeze.
- Sometimes all buttons including Power stop responding.
- I can put it into Wires-X mode and it functions normally sometimes.
