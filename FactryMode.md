# FACTRY mode

Somehow I managed to put the radio into what I'm calling Factory mode.
- Menus have Japanese writing.
- Holding the Main button to bring up the menu to do a factory reset opens the AES adjustment menu and Back returns to main screen.
- Pressing Func brings up the quick menu, but you cannot select anything and this sometimes causes the interface to freeze.
